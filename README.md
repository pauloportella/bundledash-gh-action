# Bundlewatch GitHub Action

This GitHub action allows you to easily run [bundlewatch](https://github.com/bundlewatch/bundlewatch) in your repository.

## How to use:

1. Add bundlewatch configuration in your package.json. Refer to this [doc](https://bundlewatch.io/#/getting-started/using-a-config-file) for more complete explanation.

   ```
   {
     "name": "my-package",
     "bundlewatch": {
       "trackBranches": [
         "master"
       ],
       "files": [
         {
           "path": "./packages/react-isomorphic-data/dist/esm/index.js",
           "maxSize": "4.5 KB"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   An example of a real-world project using this can be seen [here](https://github.com/jackyef/react-isomorphic-data/blob/master/package.json#L67)

2. Get a `BUNDLEWATCH_GITHUB_TOKEN` by following this [step](https://github.com/bundlewatch/bundlewatch#ci-auth-variables-needed-by-bundlewatch)

3. Set the token as a secret in your GitHub repository

4. Setup a workflow.yml for your tracked branch. For example, if you are tracking the bundlesize of master branch, you should create a workflow whenever a `push` to `master` happen like so:

   ```yml
   name: 'Bundlewatch Github Action - on Tracked Branches Push'

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - master

   jobs:
     bundlewatch:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v1
         - uses: Borales/actions-yarn@v2.1.0
         - run: yarn install
         - uses: pauloportella/bundledash-gh-action@master
           with:
             build-script: yarn build:minify
             bundlewatch-github-token: ${{ secrets.BUNDLEWATCH_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```

   You would probably want to change the `build-script` to whatever script you want to run to produce your output bundle.

   _Note: `build-script` is actually optional, just in case your workflow does not need build step and you are measuring the size of already committed files_

5. For adding statuses on pull requests, you can add another workflow for pull requests `synchronize` and `opened` events as following:

   ```yml
   name: 'Bundlewatch Github Action'

   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [synchronize, opened]

   jobs:
     bundlewatch:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v1
         - uses: Borales/actions-yarn@v2.1.0
         - run: yarn install
         - uses: pauloportella/bundledash-gh-action@master
           with:
             build-script: yarn build:minify
             bundlewatch-github-token: ${{ secrets.BUNDLEWATCH_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   ```
